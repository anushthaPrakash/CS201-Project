-In this project we implemented Boogle by using trie data structure.
-You can run this code any IDE (eg VS Code) with a gcc compiler(eg Mingw).
-First the program ask the dimentions of the boggle and then we can either insert the whole boggle or let the program make a random boggle.
-For inputing the whole boggle, input space separated Alphabets in upper case like a matrix.
-Then it will find all the three letter meaningful words in the boggle.
-you want to find if the boggle has your name also in it? no worries! you can also add words you want want to find.
-The output will be all the words the program finds in the boggle.
